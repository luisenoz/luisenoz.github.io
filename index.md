Hello and welcome to my blog on Deep Learning using fastai.

## Be aware, this is not only my fisrt experience with fastai, but my first blog ever!

My intention for the blog is to use it as a learning tool to take notes, make comments and raise questions from my experence whith DL for Coders with fastai and pytorch, from Jeremy Howard & Sylvain Gugger.

I decided to study DL to be able to experiment their application to develop some kind of predictive model of price evolution of different financial assets (forex, bonds, shares, ETFs, options, etc.).

I know mine is not the most original and easiest target, and that there have been thousands of people a lot better prepared than me and with huge resources available to investigate the same thing I'm trying to do at home in my free time and in my MacBook. But the big difference in my favour is that I'm not trying to become a millonaire but only learn what's possible to do, and enjoy the journey, whatever the final result.

Any thoughts, questions or suggestions are more than welcome.

Thanks for reading,
Luis
