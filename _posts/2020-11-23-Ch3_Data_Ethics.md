# Data Ethics

In this chapter, the authors and Dr. Rachel Thomas (co-author of fastai) introduced us to a discusiion on data ethics, 
or the branch of ethics that studies and evaluates moral problems related to data.   
Because deep learning is such a powerful tool and can be used for so many things, it becomes particularly important 
that we consider the consequences of our choices when designing a model.  
Unfortunately, as Jeremy himself agrees, no one really agrees on what right and wrong are, whether they exist, how to spot them, 
which people are good and which bad, or pretty much anything else. **So donâ€™t expect too much from the theory!**

The authors' idea is to close the summary loop that we initiated in Chapter 1 and finsihed with a complete model deployed as an app in the web,
because considering the ethics implications of using our new model should be the next step before we put it in production. Actually, ethics condieration
should have been included all the way during our work in the model, particularly every time we take one options over others in the project, 
and reviewed integrally once we consider our model is ready to go.

I don't disagree with the authors' approach, because it's a valid and logic one for how they structured their book, but for my blog, 
I'd like to just keep this knowledge that ethics is another issue to consider during my project, as important as data, types of network, parameters, etc.; 
but wait until I have a better and deeper perspective of what and how things could be done with DL, before delving into more details on data ethics.

I'll resume this topic once I finished all the technical chapters in the book and ended up with, I hope, a much better understanding and broader perspective
than the one I have at the moment.
