> BIG LESSON LEARNED:
Just before starting, let me tell you I lost a complete file with all my notes fron Chapter 2, because I didn't commit the file and closed the page in Github.
So I learnt the hard way that whatever you write or code in **any kind of file doesn't exist in Github until you commit it**, at least for the first time.
_Never leave or close a file/page in Github without commit it, becasue there us no way to recover it!_

# Chapter 2 - From Model to Production

In this chapter, we’re going to use a computer vision example (a bear classifier!!!) to look at the end-to-end process of creating a deep learning application.  
In the process, we’ll discuss:
- the capabilities and constraints of deep learning, 
- explore how to create datasets, 
- look at possible problems when using deep learning in practice, 
- and more.

## The Practice of Deep Learning

Underestimating the constraints and overestimating the capabilities of deep learning may lead to frustratingly poor results.  
Conversely, overestimating the constraints and underestimating the capabilities of deep learning may mean you do not attempt 
a solvable problem because you talk yourself out of it.  
If you keep an open mind and remain open to the possibility that deep learning might solve part of your problem with less data or complexity than you expect, 
you can design a process through which you can find the specific capabilities and constraints related to your particular problem.  

### Starting your project

1. You must have a project to work on.
2. When selecting a project, the most important consideration is data availability.
3. You have to start quickly (*don't wait to have the perfect dataset*).
4. You should iterate from end to end (*don’t spend months fine-tuning your model, or polishing the perfect GUI, or labeling the perfect dataset.
Instead, complete every step as well as you can in a reasonable amount of time, all the way to the end.
5. By using the end-to-end iteration approach, you will also get a better understanding of how much data you really need.
6. it’s probably easiest to get started on a project related to something you are already doing.
7. Maybe you can’t find the exact data you need for the precise project you have in mind; 
but you might be able to find something from a similar domain, or measured in a different way, tackling a slightly different problem.
8. It’s not a good idea to branch out into very different areas, to places that deep learning has not been applied to before. That’s because:
- if your model does not work at first, you will not know whether it is because you have made a mistake, 
or if the very problem you are trying to solve is simply not solvable with deep learning. 
- you won’t know where to look to get help.
